# 🔄 Update Your Google Apps Script

## Issue: Admin Panel Emails Are Bland

When you approve/reject from admin panel = bland emails  
When you test directly in script = professional emails

**Reason:** Your deployed Google Apps Script still has the old simple email templates.

## ✅ **Solution:**

### **1. Copy Updated Code**
1. **Select ALL code** from your `instructor-form-handler.js` file
2. **Copy it** (Ctrl+A, then Ctrl+C)
3. **Go to your Google Apps Script** project
4. **Select all existing code** and **replace it** with the new code
5. **Save** (Ctrl+S)

### **2. Redeploy (Important!)**
1. Click **"Deploy"** → **"Manage deployments"**
2. Click the **pencil icon** (edit) next to your existing deployment
3. Change **"Version"** to **"New version"**
4. Click **"Deploy"**
5. **Copy the new Web App URL** (if it changed)

### **3. Test Again**
- Try approving/rejecting from admin panel
- You should now see the professional email templates
