# üöÄ Final Setup Steps for Instructor Application Workflow

## Current Status: ‚úÖ 95% Complete

Your instructor application workflow is almost ready! Here are the final steps to make it fully functional:

## üîß Step 1: Update Google Apps Script Form ID

**CRITICAL:** Your Google Apps Script needs the correct form ID.

### Get Your Form ID:
1. Go to your Google Form: `https://forms.gle/Vnmm2CpPHiP59Wmd8`
2. Click **"Edit"** (or the pencil icon)
3. Look at the URL - it should change to: `https://docs.google.com/forms/d/[LONG_FORM_ID]/edit`
4. Copy the `[LONG_FORM_ID]` part (it's usually 40+ characters long)

### Update the Script:
1. Open your Google Apps Script project
2. Find line 700 in `instructor-form-handler.js`:
   ```javascript
   const formId = 'REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_ACTUAL_LONG_FORM_ID'; // ‚ö†Ô∏è MUST BE UPDATED
   ```
3. Replace with your actual form ID:
   ```javascript
   const formId = 'YOUR_ACTUAL_LONG_FORM_ID_HERE';
   ```

## üîß Step 2: Set Up Form Trigger

1. In Google Apps Script, select `setupFormTrigger` from the function dropdown
2. Click **Run** (‚ñ∂Ô∏è)
3. Grant permissions when prompted
4. Check the logs for "‚úÖ Form trigger created successfully"

## üîß Step 3: Deploy Updated Script

1. Click **Deploy** ‚Üí **New Deployment**
2. Choose **Web app** as type
3. Set **Execute as**: Me
4. Set **Who has access**: Anyone
5. Click **Deploy**
6. Copy the new web app URL

## üîß Step 4: Update Admin Panel (if URL changed)

If you got a new deployment URL, update line 3953 in `admin.html`:
```javascript
const response = await fetch('YOUR_NEW_SCRIPT_URL', {
```

## üß™ Step 5: Test the Complete Workflow

### Test Form Submission:
1. Go to `apply.html` and click "Start Your Application"
2. Fill out and submit the form
3. Check Google Apps Script execution logs
4. Verify the application appears in your admin panel

### Test Admin Approval:
1. Go to `admin.html` ‚Üí Applications tab
2. Click "Approve" on a test application
3. Check that approval email is sent
4. Verify the instructor setup link works

## üéØ What Should Work After Setup:

‚úÖ **Form Submissions**: Applications appear in admin panel  
‚úÖ **Email Notifications**: Confirmation, approval, and rejection emails  
‚úÖ **Admin Panel**: Review and approve/reject applications  
‚úÖ **Instructor Setup**: Bank details and Paystack subaccount creation  
‚úÖ **Payment Integration**: 90/10 revenue split with automatic payouts  

## üîç Troubleshooting:

### If applications don't appear in admin:
- Check Google Apps Script execution logs
- Verify form ID is correct (long ID, not short share ID)
- Ensure trigger is set up correctly

### If emails aren't sent:
- Check Gmail permissions in Google Apps Script
- Verify admin email is correct (no trailing spaces)
- Check script deployment URL in admin.html

### If Paystack integration fails:
- Verify environment variables in Netlify
- Check Paystack API keys are correct
- Ensure Firebase Admin SDK is properly configured

## üìß Environment Variables Needed:

Make sure these are set in your Netlify environment:
- `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY` (JSON string)
- `PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY`
- `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`

## üéâ Once Complete:

Your instructor application workflow will be fully operational with:
- Automated form processing
- Professional email notifications
- Admin review system
- Secure payment setup
- Automatic Paystack subaccount creation

The system is designed to handle the complete instructor onboarding process from application to payment setup automatically.
